Community development project or CDP is a course focusing on increasing
social sensitivity and personality of students while working on community
services and solving issues face by people of that community.

I have worked with such a project of adopting a Guava Plant.I have worked
there from 15 June 2022 to 15 July 2022.I learnt new experiences while 
adopting and taking care of Guava plant and creating awareness among peoples
near my locality and motivating them to adopt a plant.
